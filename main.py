# The backend is now nearly done, with only tasks left to clean up
# As for the UI, Widgets for pretty much everything are almost done, only thing left is 
# to add each widget to QScrollArea, QHBoxLayout and QVBoxLayouts and UI will be finished
# Functions for connecting the backend to the ui haven't had any work started on them

#Setup the Classes
from Codebase.Classes import classes

# Also rohit if you're reading this I couldn't do the UI stuff yet, sorry
# I'll work on them tonight and this'll mostly be done by this saturday
# which leaves 2 days for fixing bugs and adding any last minute features
#Yeah that's fine, I don't think she's gonna ask anything today anyways?
#Anyways, if you read this by 2 50 pm, tell if there's anything I can do
