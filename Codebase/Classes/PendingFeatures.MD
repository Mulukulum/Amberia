**Completion or Deletion**

COMPLETE != DELETE

Completion of a task/project just changes a "iscompleted" attribute on it.
(I was considering moving them to a whole other table but that seemed kind of wasteful and complicated to handle
I'll leave it upto you guys to discuss how you'd like to implement it)

This is because being able to do a quick undo for accidentally completing tasks is useful

**Other Task Related Things:**


**Task Constructor:**
Having a task constructor would be useful. User specifies just names for multiple tasks
and you get a list of them where ever the original "task constructor" task was.

Could Probably use this a lot when making templates because I can see that being useful 

**YOUR TEXT HERE**

A text task, its just that. Its a bunch of text which doesn't count for overall completion. 
It only exists to add notes to stuff.

**Again?**

Tasks should probably be able to repeat perodically
Ideally we give the user options as to how they'd like to
have the tasks repeated

Again, implementation is your discretion. 

Keep an eye on the '\#pending-features' channel, I'll ping you guys if theres anything important

You will be left with a lot of questions and probably won't understand all of it perfectly
because I suck at explaining things properly so just ask if you need help understanding something
